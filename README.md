# 🌞 Sunshot Website

**A high-impact beauty and skincare website** built with **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**. This project translates a **neo-brutalism + minimalism** design into a responsive, performance-focused application.

## ✨ Design & Vision

The core aesthetic is **strong contrast** and **clean structure** based on a **12-column grid**.

* **Identity:** Typography is the main visual element (large, bold headlines).
* **Color:** A restrained palette (`navy`, `yellow`, `red`, etc.) defines sections.
* **Interaction:** Features a signature hover state (yellow fill, navy border) for interactivity.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Technology | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Next.js** | React framework for routing and performance. |
| **Tailwind CSS** | Utility-first, mobile-first styling. |
| **Next.js `<Image>`** | Optimized image assets. |

### Layout

Built on a **12-column grid** foundation. Components are highly reusable and mobile-first, adapting smoothly from **stacked** to **split-screen** layouts.

## 🧩 Key Features

* **Hero:** Bold headline with dual CTAs.
* **Collection:** Dynamic product cards with alternating layouts.
* **Contact:** Responsive two-column form for quick connection.
* **Footer:** Clear, structured navigation and social links.

## 🔮 Roadmap

1.  Complete **About Us** and **Contact** page content.
2.  Add micro-animations.
3.  Implement the full **Modern Standard Arabic** version.
