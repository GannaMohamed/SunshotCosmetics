# 🌞 Sunshot Website

**A high-impact beauty and skincare website** built with **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**. This project translates a **neo-brutalism + minimalism** design into a responsive, performance-focused application.

## ✨ Design & Vision

The core aesthetic is **strong contrast** and **clean structure** based on a **12-column grid**.

* **Grid**: Built on a 12-column grid for consistency and clarity, and 8-point grid system for spaces, typography, sizes.

* **Identity**: Bold typography as the main visual element.

* **Color Palette**: Navy, baby blue, yellow, red, black, and grey — balanced contrast with restraint.

* **Interaction**: Hover states with yellow fill + navy border for vibrancy.

* **Layout Style**: Neo-brutalist influence with vibrant colors, sharp typography, light black borders, generous whitespace, and slim buttons for a refined, modern feel.
